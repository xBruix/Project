        A queue Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a linear data structure that operates on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.<br>
        It represents a collection of elements where new elements are added to the rear and existing elements are removed from the front.<br>
        Queues enforce a strict order of operations: elements are processed in the same order they were added. <br>
        Additionally, queues typically support operations such as peeking (viewing the element at the front without removing it), <br>
        checking if the queue is empty, and determining its size. Queues find applications in scenarios where the order of processing matters, such as task scheduling, breadth-first search algorithms, and job scheduling in operating systems.
